updated, and deleted.

## Example usage

```hcl
resource "wavefront_cloud_integration_aws_external_id" "ext_id" { 
}

resource "wavefront_cloud_integration_ec2" "ec2" {
  name        = "Test Integration"
  role_arn    = "arn:aws::1234567:role/example-arn"
  external_id = wavefront_cloud_integration_aws_external_id.ext_id.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `service` - (Required) A value denoting which cloud service this service integrates with.
* `name` - (Required) The human-readable name of this integration.
* `additional_tags` - (Optional) A list of point tag key-values to add to every point ingested using this integration.
* `force_save` - (Optional) Forces this resource to save, even if errors are present.
* `service_refresh_rate_in_minutes` - (Optional) How often, in minutes, to refresh the service.

* `hostname_tags` - (Optional) A list of AWS instance tags to use as the `source` name
in a series. Default is `["hostname", "host", "name"]`. If no tag in the list is found, the series source
is set to the instance id.

```hcl
resource "wavefront_cloud_integration_aws_external_id" "ext_id" {
}

resource "wavefront_cloud_integration_ec2" "ec2" {
  name       = "Test Integration"
  force_save = true
  additional_tags = {
    "tag1" = "value1"
    "tag2" = "value2"
  }
  role_arn    = "arn:aws::1234567:role/example-arn"
  external_id = wavefront_cloud_integration_aws_external_id.ext_id.id
  hostname_tags  = ["host", "source", "name"]
  service_refresh_rate_in_minutes = 10
}
